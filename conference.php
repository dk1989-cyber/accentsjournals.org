								     <p>The main objective of ACCENT Society (ACCENTS) is to promote research and development works. For this, ACCENTS organizes various international conferences, workshops and training programs from time to time. In this way research on different subjects is shared with other intellectuals. This is a platform where engineers and researchers can share their research works and present their views/observations/comments on different research issues. The keynote speakers of these conferences and workshops are experts of their fields. ACCENTS publishes these research works in the form of book as well as online in the conference section of ACCENTS website.

Our society invites technical universities, colleges and research institutions to take part in these events to accomplish our goals.

In case you are interested in organizing / sponsoring the conferences, workshops and training programs, you can contact us at conference@theaccents.org.</p>
